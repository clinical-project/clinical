A dental clinic is facing challenges in efficiently managing patient appointments, resulting in significant delays, patient dissatisfaction, and decreased productivity. The current manual appointment scheduling system lacks optimization, leading to suboptimal utilization of dental resources and ineffective time management. Therefore, the clinic requires a system that can streamline the appointment scheduling process, improve overall efficiency, and enhance patient experience.
